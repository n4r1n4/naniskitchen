					<span class="titleSub"> HER ROOTS </span>
					<p>My Nani, Pritam, affectionately known as Gudi (because she looked like a doll growing up!),
						has a story that begins in Punjab. She was born there before moving to Malaysia as a baby
						during the partition of Pakistan. As the eldest of seven siblings, she grew up in
						the vibrant town of Malacca, nurturing her love for cooking amidst a bustling household.
						After marrying my grandfather, she moved to Petaling Jaya, where she continues to reside.
					</p>

					<p>A dedicated English school teacher, Nani inspired countless students across secondary schools
						in Malacca Town. Beyond the classroom, she has a passion for gardening, sewing, and
						storytelling.
						Her vibrant garden is a testament to her green thumb, while her beautifully crafted clothes
						and
						captivating tales reflect her creativity and warmth. Nani's big heart, selflessness, and
						generosity
						shine through in everything she does. Through her cooking, she keeps the rich traditions of
						her Punjabi heritage alive, sharing her love and passion with every dish she prepares.</p>

					<p>Nani's heart and home are the center of our family. She has three children, who have
						blessed her with eight grandchildren. Nani played a crucial role in raising every one of us
						from when we were babies, creating a close-knit family bound by love and shared traditions.
					</p>

					<p>Every now and then, she hosts dinners and lunches at her house, where we gather to indulge
						in our favorite foodâ€”her exceptional cooking. These gatherings are filled with laughter,
						love,
						and the delicious aroma of her secret and treasured family recipes. We often joke about
						opening a
						restaurant dedicated to her culinary masterpieces, aptly named Nani's Kitchen. Her meals are
						are a testament to her dedication, love, and the rich heritage she
						cherishes and shares with all of us. </p>
